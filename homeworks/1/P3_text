\begin{itemize}
 \item Parts (a) and (b). We installed the corresponding libraries in all of our machines.
 
 \item Part (c). After running \textit{hello\_world.f90}, we succeded in getting the message
 \begin{verbatim}
 Hello, my processor rank is           0
 \end{verbatim}
 Then, we increased the number of processors and got a list showing the rank of all the processors. For example,
 for \textit{-np 10}, the list was
 \begin{verbatim}
 Hello, my processor rank is           0
 Hello, my processor rank is           1
 Hello, my processor rank is           5
 Hello, my processor rank is           6
 Hello, my processor rank is           9
 Hello, my processor rank is           7
 Hello, my processor rank is           3
 Hello, my processor rank is           4
 Hello, my processor rank is           8
 Hello, my processor rank is           2
 \end{verbatim}
 After trying larger numbers, we proved that we are able to execute more processors than any of our machines physically has.
 
 \item Part (d) In order to explore the execution time and performance, we included the simple operation
 \begin{equation}
  a = \exp(5+0.001 b),
 \end{equation}
 where $b$ is a random number obtained at each iteration (see code below). As we increase the number of processors (\textit{np}), 
 the execution time in any node decreases. For example, for $np = 1, \,2,\,3$, we obtain, respectively,
 \begin{verbatim}
 Hello, my processor rank is 0 of 1 Processors taking 2.30102539 seconds.
 
 Hello, my processor rank is 0 of 2 Processors taking 1.89941406 seconds.
 Hello, my processor rank is 1 of 2 Processors taking 1.91113281 seconds.
 
 Hello, my processor rank is 2 of 3 Processors taking 0.790527344 seconds.
 Hello, my processor rank is 1 of 3 Processors taking 0.792480469 seconds.
 Hello, my processor rank is 0 of 3 Processors taking 0.793457031 seconds.
 \end{verbatim}
One thing we immediately notice is that the execution time varies in each node. We will come back to this later. 


\end{itemize}
